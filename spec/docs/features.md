# Features

The site bookmarking system is designed to provide a comprehensive set of features that enhance the way users manage and interact with their bookmarks. The following features are key components of the system:

**1. Site bookmarking**

Users can easily add new bookmarks, view and edit existing ones, and delete bookmarks they no longer need. The system offers a straightforward interface to manage bookmarks efficiently.

**2. Categorization, tagging, and full-text search search**

Users can organize bookmarks into customizable categories, making it easier to group related sites. These bookmarks can be tagged with keywords, allowing for flexible organization and easier retrieval. Also, a powerful search function enables users to find bookmarks quickly based on categories, tags, or text within the bookmark details.

**3. Automatic availability checking**

The system automatically checks the availability of bookmarked sites and alerts users if any sites are dead or inaccessible. This helps users keep their bookmarks up-to-date and relevant. users can also trigger the check manually and change the check frequency settings.

**4. Custom home page builder**

Users can create a custom home page that features their most-used bookmarks arranged in a visually appealing layout. This page can be set as the default home page in their browser, providing quick access to frequently visited sites.

**5. Import and export browser bookmarks**

The system supports importing and exporting bookmarks from popular browsers like Firefox and Chrome, allowing users to seamlessly move their existing bookmarks from the browser into the system or back again.

**6. Synchronization capabilities**

Users can synchronize their bookmarks across multiple devices by setting up synchronization with either a local (self-hosted) server or a remote (cloud) server. This can be done by simply selecting the server from the dropdown list. Such functionality ensures bookmarks are accessible from any device.

**7. Profiles**

To enhance privacy and focus, users can create different profiles (e.g. for work, leisure, research, and writing) to organize bookmarks based on context or usage scenarios, when simply putting the bookmarks into separate collections on the same account is not desirable. Each profile can have its own set of categories, tags, and bookmarks, allowing for tailored bookmark management.

**8. Statistics and Analytics**

The system provides statistical analysis of bookmark usage, including metrics such as frequency of use, most accessed categories, and popular tags. This helps users understand their browsing habits and optimize bookmark organization.

**9. Easy Self-Hosting**

The system is designed to be easy to deploy on a personal server, with straightforward setup instructions and minimal technical requirements. This feature is ideal for users who prefer to maintain control over their data and hosting environment.

**10. Browser Plugin**

A browser plugin is available to streamline the process of saving bookmarks. Users can right-click on any webpage and select "Save to..." to quickly add the site to their bookmarks, with options to categorize and tag it on the fly.
