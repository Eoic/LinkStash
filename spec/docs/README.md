# Introduction

## Overview

The project aims to provide an easy-to-use solution for organizing, sharing, and interacting with site bookmarks. The system provides users with robust tools to manage bookmarks efficiently, offering features like categorization, tagging, and search functionalities. Additionally, it includes advanced capabilities such as automatic availability checking of saved sites, profile management, and statistical analysis of bookmark usage.

## Scope

This project will focus on developing a full-featured bookmarking system that can be easily used across different platforms and browsers. The system will support local and remote synchronization, making it suitable for various user environments, from personal to professional settings. The project will also emphasize the ease of self-hosting, ensuring advanced users can deploy the system on their servers with minimal effort.

## Objectives

The objectives of the bookmarking system are:

* To provide a user-friendly interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) site bookmarks.
* To enable users to organize bookmarks using categories, and tags, and make use of search capabilities.
* To implement automatic checks to ensure the availability of bookmarked sites.
* To allow users to build a customizable home page featuring their most-used links.
* To facilitate the import and export of bookmarks from popular browsers like Firefox and Chrome.
* To offer synchronization options for local and remote servers, ensuring bookmark access across devices.
* To support user profiles for managing different sets of bookmarks (e.g., work, leisure).
* To provide statistical insights into bookmark usage by frequency, category, and tag.
* To make the system easy to self-host, catering to users who prefer control over their data.
* To integrate with web browsers through a plugin that simplifies the process of saving new bookmarks.
